# For prepating non linear optimazation programming

- Matrix algorithm
- #Grim Schmitdit = to find Q for QR decomposition
- #QR decomposition = to find eigen value
- #Eigen decomposition = to find eigen vector
- #Inverse Matrix

# problem
when obtaining eigenvectors by using rref it has problem\
by the real number diff with float errorvalue in reduce form\
To solve this problem 

IDEA
1.  Guassian normalization 
2.  log


$$x_{n+1,k} + sign(f) * e^{\ln(|x_{n+1,i}|) - \ln(|x_{n,i}|) +  \ln(|x_{n,k}|)}$$

4.  etc

- Equation solving algorithm 
- #reading and converting equation = to convert equation for readable 
- #post fix algorithm = to order for calculating
- (unexpected problem was 
- 1. distinguish sign of negative and subtract, 
- 2. different methods for trigonalmetric, log and power.. etc
