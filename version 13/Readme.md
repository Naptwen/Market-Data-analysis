For prepating non linear optimazation programming

- Matrix algorithm
- #Grim Schmitdit = to find Q for QR decomposition
- #QR decomposition = to find eigen value
- #Eigen decomposition = to find eigen vector
- #Inverse Matrix

- Equation solving algorithm 
- #reading and converting equation = to convert equation for readable 
- #post fix algorithm = to order for calculating
- (unexpected problem was 
- 1. distinguish sign of negative and subtract, 
- 2. different methods for trigonalmetric, log and power.. etc
