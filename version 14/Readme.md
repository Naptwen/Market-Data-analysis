#Update April 2022.\
1. NLP for "THE_LEVENBERG_MARQUARDT_GAUSS_NEWTON_AMIJO_LINE_SEARCH" and "QUASI_BFGS_NEWTON_AMIJO_LINE_SEARCH"
-The algorithm is based on studying from the lecture of UCSD Philip E.Gill 2021 NonLinear Programming !
3. Fix in bug and error in matrix multiplication, eigenvalue, decomposition, echelon elimination
4. Bunch of matrix calculating algorithm
